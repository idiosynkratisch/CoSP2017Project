K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,16,,B,14,1,One day not long before Christmas Paddington was busy doing his accounts when he heard Mrs Bird singing which was most unusual.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,17,,B,14,2,As he listened to the words he nearly fell off his chair with surprise.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,18,,B,14,3,It seemed her true love had sent her a present from a partridge in a pear tree.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,19,,B,14,4,As it happened Paddington was having trouble about what to buy the Brown family for Christmas and he wished he'd thought of it himself.,,

K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,21,,B,16,1,We'll find out in a moment.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,22,,B,16,2,He hurried out into the garden but to his disappointment he couldn't see a pear tree anywhere let alone one with a partridge in it.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,23,,B,16,3,He gazed hopefully at Mr Brown's apple tree.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,24,,B,16,4,But apart from a few sparrows and a robin redbreast  --,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,25,,B,16,5,--the branches were bare.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,26,,B,16,6,Paddington made his way back in doors.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,27,,B,16,7,And no sooner was he inside when he heard Mrs Brown singing that her true love had sent four calling birds three french hens two turtle doves not to mention another partridge in a pear tree.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,28,,A,17,1,Hm,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,29,,B,18,1,Paddington could hardly believe his ears and he hurried back outside as fast as he could go but once again he was too late.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,30,,B,18,2,Even the sparrows and the robin redbreast had flown away and all that was left was one fat old pigeon sitting in the lawn.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,31,,B,18,3,All the same Paddington decided to keep his eyes and ears open.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,32,,B,18,4,Clearly there was something going on.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,33,,B,18,5,Sure enough no sooner had he settled down it was Judy's time to break into song.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,34,,B,18,6,This time she announced it wasn't Mrs Brown's four calling birds three French hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree she had been five gold rings.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,35,,B,18,7,Paddington decided that Browns must have a very rich friend indeed if he could afford so many presents.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,36,,B,18,8,It made his list look very small.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,37,,B,18,9,He couldn't afford much more than a set of plastic rings let alone five gold ones.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,38,,B,18,10,Over the next few days the mystery deepened.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,39,,B,18,11,Seven swans swimming arrived and disappeared  --,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,40,,B,18,12,--again before Paddington had a chance to see them.,,

K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,44,,B,20,1,But Paddington did find a note on the door step asking for two extra pints and things.,,

K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,46,,B,22,1,Hm table tennis.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,47,,B,22,2,He began to wonder if he aught to ring for the police but no one else seemed to be in the slightest bit worried.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,48,,B,22,3,When Paddington heard what Mrs Bird sang next.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,49,,B,22,4,Nine ladies dancing he decided perhaps that she had ordered the extra milk in case they got thirsty.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,50,,B,22,5,He searched the house from top to bottom.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,51,,B,22,6,There was no sign of any body.,,

K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,53,,B,22,8,It seemed he had been sent no less than ten lords a leaping.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,54,,B,22,9,Paddington decided to go see his friend Mr Grover who kept an antique shop in Portabello Road.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,55,,B,22,10,Apart from all the antiques Mr Grover also had piles of books about every subject under the sun and Paddington felt sure he would be able to explain the mystery.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,56,,B,22,11,As soon as Paddington arrived Mr Grover made some cocoa and they settled down on the horse hair sofa at the back of the shop.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,57,,B,22,12,Tell me Mr Brown he said what is the problem.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,58,,B,22,13,I can see that you are very worried about something.,,

K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,60,,B,22,15,He sent all sorts of Christmas presents but as fast as they arrive they disappear.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,61,,B,22,16,Mr Grover listened carefully as Paddington told him the story.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,62,,B,22,17,I think Mr Brown he said at last if you go back to number thirty two Windsor Gardens you'll probably find that he has sent eleven  (()) as well.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,63,,B,22,18,Paddington gazed at Mr Grover in astonishment.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,64,,B,22,19,He was used to his friends knowing the answers to his problems but this was the fastest ever.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,65,,B,22,20,He finished his cocoa as quickly as possible and he was about to leave when  --,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,66,,B,22,21,--to his surprise Mr Grover began pulling the blind down over his shop door.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,67,,B,22,22,You see Mr Brown he explained they haven't really been getting presents.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,68,,B,22,23,They've all been joining in singing a Christmas carol but you have given me an idea for your present but you'll have to hurry though -it's Christmas Eve.,,

K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,73,,B,24,2,And as they weaved their way from the stores lining the streets he explained what he had in mind.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,74,,B,24,3,Paddington grew more and more excited as he listened.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,75,,B,24,4,I don' think I shall sleep very much tonight Mr Grover he said.,,
K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,76,,B,24,5,Just leave it to me said Mr Grover I think between us and with the help of some of our friends in the market we shall be able to give everybody a Christmas to remember.,,

K/KD/KDE.xml,KDERE01R,007201,82,,B,26,4,If you ask me said Mrs Bird as she invited every one in for a hot mince pies fresh from the oven that's the nicest start to a Christmas day any one can possibly wish for but then she added and with general agreement with a bear like Paddington about the house life is always full of surprises.,,
