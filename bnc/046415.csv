K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,2,,A,3,1,"Mm, mm",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,3,,B,4,1,work.,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,4,,B,4,2,I said I'm quite sure there must be something that could be done computer-wise,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,5,,A,5,1,Right,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,6,,B,6,1,"but he sort of pooh-poohed it and sort of said well you know, we're getting a bit to old for all this modern sophistication of computers and so on, well I said well quite frankly I am not totally in agreement with you, because as you probably know Clyde  <<REDACTED (name)>> was looking into a program which will could alleviate a lot",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,7,,A,7,1,"Yes I know, I know",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,8,,B,8,1,"of the work, that I do, but I",,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,12,,B,12,1,"that I have downstairs, because it's, if it was to be computerized, it would be a massive great bloody great volume",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,13,,A,13,1,Yes,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,14,,B,14,1,and I would be carrying this around and it just wouldn't be feasible,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,15,,A,15,1,"Quite, right",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,16,,B,16,1,so he said that apparently whenever he came back to B S H he was told by Neville roughly about eighteen hundred acres would be sort of his target,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,17,,A,17,1,"Target, right",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,18,,B,18,1,"and it's, it's multiplied by about three or four times that you see",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,19,,A,19,1,"Oh right, right, right",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,20,,B,20,1,"so consequently he's getting inundated, he really is apparently under pressure",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,21,,A,21,1,"Mm, mm, right",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,22,,B,22,1,so this is why I raised the very conversation about it,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,23,,A,23,1,"Right, right",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,24,,B,24,1,"and er, I said well look I'll have a word with the erm, with and see if he can think of anything that might",,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,26,,B,26,1,"all things in mind that are possible on er, on er, on er computer, and he said that he hadn't much time to think about it and said well look, maybe over Easter",,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,32,,B,32,1,"so he's going to do that, so I said well look, do you mind if I had a wee sort of prelim- talk with him",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,33,,A,33,1,Right,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,34,,B,34,1,"see if, if it's a possibility",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,35,,A,35,1,Right,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,36,,B,36,1,"What he's looking for is certified numbers, field numbers",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,37,,A,37,1,That sort of,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,38,,B,38,1,all this sort of information,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,39,,A,39,1,"<cough> right, well the, the, well there's good news on that front because in our, in the actual new version of the seeds package which we have now",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,40,,B,40,1,Yeah,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,41,,A,41,1,erm developed and it's gonna be released in the next few months,,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,45,,A,45,1,and indeed keeping the history of fields and so on,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,46,,B,46,1,Right oh I see,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,47,,A,47,1,in that  (()) and I know Alec has seen the previous version of this package,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,48,,B,48,1,Right,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,49,,A,49,1,"and er it was certainly er then, a very primitive",,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,55,,A,55,1,keyed into the system,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,56,,B,56,1,"Yeah, yeah",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,57,,A,57,1,erm and since the volume has increased quite dramatically,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,58,,B,58,1,Yeah,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,59,,A,59,1,he's heavenly gonna need outside help to do this,,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,61,,A,61,1,It's just him,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,62,,B,62,1,it's him,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,63,,A,63,1,"I, you see that, that, that, initially he is gonna have a problem",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,64,,B,64,1,You see he's so  (()),,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,65,,A,65,1,Yeah,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,66,,B,66,1,and then he's coming back to this mass of work,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,67,,A,67,1,He has to get it done,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,68,,B,68,1,"and er, and, and, he feels look, well I'm caring with it now but some time",,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,78,,B,78,1,That's right,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,79,,A,79,1,because I'm ab- I'm absolutely convinced having seen the package,,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,83,,A,83,1,and it's easily updated because er from what I've seen now you can actually key in sort of the acreage and then update the crop inspecting reports,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,84,,B,84,1,Right,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,85,,A,85,1,and each time you go out and look at the crop update,,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,91,,A,91,1,"and then erm it will as you go along, as the crops are actually growing in the fields, you can change the yield on it so as",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,92,,B,92,1,"Oh, aye",,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,97,,A,97,1,the harvest is gonna be,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,98,,B,98,1,"Oh that's excellent because er I said, he said oh I don't want to be lugged with a big computer sort of thing and so on, so I said well you might, you might be able to get",,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,99,,A,99,1,It's,,
K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,100,,B,100,1,a little portable thing that can,,

K/KD/KDU.xml,KDURE00E,046415,128,,B,126,1,"as possible to make it easier for them to set it up, is that we're hoping to develop within the next er few months in fact, a certification form",,
