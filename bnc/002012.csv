K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,1,,B,2,1,Yes?,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,2,,A,3,1,And he called Gary  <<REDACTED (name)>> saying we don't have the P elevens.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,3,,A,3,2,And I  I said oh well that's fair enough so I dug them out and sent them to him.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,4,,A,3,3,And after I'd stamped and sealed the envelopes  he rang back he said I haven't got the copy VAT certs either.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,5,,A,3,4,I was not pleased at that!,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,6,,A,3,5,"And I, wouldn't have occurred to me to send the P elevens.",,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,7,,B,4,1,Actually that's not true either because I sent the P elevens to Steve and Matthew  for his approval before we sent them off.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,8,,A,5,1,And he sent them back again?,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,9,,B,6,1,Erm.,,

K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,13,,B,8,1,I doubt that he sent them back.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,14,,A,9,1,"Oh well, I I've sent the ones from the drawer",,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,15,,B,10,1,Fine.,,

K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,20,,A,15,1,No.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,21,,A,15,2,"That that, well  you know if there's a query in the next fortnight we know where they are don't we?",,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,22,,A,15,3,"But I was annoyed and I thought well that's fair enough because I wasn't aware that those particular documents were required by the accountants to sort things out, but",,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,23,,B,16,1,Why were they required?,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,24,,A,17,1,I don't know.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,25,,A,17,2,I didn't ask him but he said he required them.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,26,,A,17,3,"But I know that copy VAT certs, the VAT certs, VAT payment return, returns that's what they're called aren't they, are required.",,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,27,,A,17,4,And so we hadn't sent them.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,28,,B,18,1,Oh.,,

K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,38,,B,24,2,But it's reeling onto that one?,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,39,,A,25,1,It's not it's reeling through there.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,40,,A,25,2,Very confusing and the fact that they've stuck that label on there doesn't help very much either.,,
K/KB/KBK.xml,KBKRE00B,002012,41,,B,26,1,"No, so, when it's full you have to put another tape in, does it",,
